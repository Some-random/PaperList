## Improve Planning abilities using RL
[RetroFormer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/81b10e64133e775dab53153cc82277d276efe1f7): freezes the base LLM and trains reinforcement learning models to refine reflections through policy gradient methods
[ADAPTING LLM AGENTS THROUGH COMMUNICATION](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/0581da0255edaf47817a899116388caf7d418273) : applies PPO training directly to an open-source LLM based on feedback and agent exploration trajectories


## Analyze/Optimize reflection
 a third that transforms feedback into code to minimize feedback ambiguity; and a fourth that utilizes inter-task feedback from both successes and failures to enhance model learning.


## Analyze COT capabilities


## Open Domain QA Datasets


## Open Domain QA methods
